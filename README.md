DATA ANALYTICS, BIG DATA AND PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS PROJECT

This project has 4 folders as follows:
1. Main
2. Data
3. Code
4. Technical Reports

The main folder consists of the literature document which has the abstract and literature review.
The Data folder consists of various files used for analysis in this project.
The Code folder consists of the code written in a certain programming language.
Technical Reports folder consists of the output of the code.

Refer to read.me files in the individual folders for more details.

The tentative stages of the project are as follows:

A. - Import the data using RStudio and carry out exploratory Data analyses to understand the type of data, its distribution and missing values etc

B. - Clean the data to replace and missing values with the mean or median values based on the distribution of the data

C. - After the dataset is ready for analyses, start with implementing the first model - Linear Regression Analysis. This analysis will allow a curve to be fitted to predict the dependent variable (GDP Growth) using the independent variables (Education, Health and Financial Sector parameters).

D. - Implement the second model - KNN Classification Algorithm and analyse the predicted values

E. - Decide on which model to be implemented as a third model (Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes Classification or any other classification algorithm) and analyse.

F. - Prepare the Project Report summarizing the findings and ascertaining remarks on continuity of work.
