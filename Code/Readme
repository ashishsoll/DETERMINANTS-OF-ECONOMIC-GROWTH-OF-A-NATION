DATA ANALYTICS, BIG DATA AND PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS PROJECT

This branch consits of the initial code written for data exploration and visualization of the data. In this part, the education dataset is analysed.
There are two variables considered for the education dataset :

Literacy rate, adult total and
Current education expenditure
The code summarizes the education dataset for multiple years from 2001 to 2020 for each of the two variables considered. Descriptive statistics such as minimum, mean values, max values etc are generated. A line graph depicts the variation of the variables over 20 years.

The code is written in R programming and will require a compatible software such as RStudio to open the file.
