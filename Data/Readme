DATA ANALYTICS, BIG DATA AND PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS PROJECT

The 'Data' branch consists of four files which are the four datasets used for analysis in the project.

These datasets have been modified from the original datasets published by the World Bank.
The World Bank published dataset includes details prior to the year 2001 as early as 1960.
For the purpose of my research, as the dataset from 1960s is not as relevant as recent data, I decided to trim the dataset
and use the data points starting from January 2001.

The original dataset files are saved as follows:

Education - Original
Financial Sector - Original
The modified dataset files which are used for my research purposes are named as follows:

Economy and Growth - Use Case
Education - Use Case 1
Education - Use Case 2
Financial Sector - Use Case 1
Financial Sector - Use Case 2
Financial Sector - Use Case 3
Financial Sector - Use Case 4
Health - Use Case 1
Health - Use Case 2
Health - Use Case 3
Education - Use Case 1 and Education Use Case 2 are two files for two variables.

The following files are larger than 25MB and could not by uploaded to the Github account.

Economy and Growth - Original
Health - Original
